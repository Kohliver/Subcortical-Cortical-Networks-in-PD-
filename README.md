# Overview

This repository contains code and scripts that were used for the main analyses and figures from the manuscript.  
The pipeline covers: data preprocessing, time-averaged STN and cortical network analyses, dynamic STN and cortical network analyses, statistical testing, and figure generation.

**Contents**
- Preprocessing (artifact removal, filtering, alignment)
- Signal analyses (spectral, connectivity, network metrics)
- STN—cortex association analyses and statistical tests
- Figure generation for the manuscript
